# Selenium Mousehunt bot

Mousehunt is a facebook game which primary features include clicking a horn every 15 minutes. Considering this is a fairly simple task that can be automated. I decided it would be a good project to work on regarding selenium's webdriver.

## Setting-up

1. Ensure you have downloaded selenium web-driver for your respective operating system
2. change the relevant details in the user_details.json file
3. to run the file enter "python main.py"


## Future Works

Currently mousehunt have installed a Captcha in an attempt to prevent users from running scripts. I will attempt to make use of image recognition to solve that issue.

## Disclaimer

I do not play mousehunt. Started this project out as a favour for a friend but thoroughly enjoyed the process.
